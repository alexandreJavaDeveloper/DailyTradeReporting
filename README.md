# DailyTradeReporting

## Some statements
- No database or UI was created.
- I assumed the code will only ever be executed in a single threaded environment.
- Used only JUnit library as external jar dependencies, just to run all tests.
- All data is saved in memory. There is no database.
- Output format in plain text, printed out to the console.
- There is no main method, only can be executed by tests.

## How to execute (running tests)
- git clone  https://github.com/alexandreJavaDeveloper/DailyTradeReporting.git
- cd DailyTradeReporting/
- mvn clean package
- At this stage, will be logged out in the console the Instruction Report. This uses all structure of the code of this project.

## Test Coverage
- 100%

## TODO
- Nothing in this moment.
